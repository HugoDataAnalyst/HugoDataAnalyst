## Hi 👋, I'm Hugo

**Data Engineer | Full-Stack Analytics Systems | Real-time Data Processing**

</div>

I build end-to-end data systems that extract, process, and serve insights at scale. I specialize in designing production-grade architectures that handle real-time data pipelines, complex analytics, and high-performance infrastructure.

Beyond analytics, I have deep expertise in system design, API development, database architecture, and DevOps—building complete solutions from data ingestion to deployment.

### Featured Work

**[PsyduckV2](https://github.com/HugoDataAnalyst/PsyduckV2)** — A production-scale analytics platform featuring real-time geospatial data processing, multi-database architecture, Redis caching, FastAPI backends, and webhook-driven pipelines. Demonstrates full-stack capabilities from infrastructure to analytics.

### Technical Stack

**Backend & Processing:** Python, FastAPI, real-time data pipelines, performance optimization

**Data & Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, geospatial analytics

**Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker, Nginx, Linux, webhook systems

**Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, GitLab, VSCode

### What I Do

- Design and implement real-time data processing pipelines
- Build scalable database architectures (relational, cache, time-series)
- Develop APIs and backend systems for data applications
- Optimize system performance (3x-4x improvements through architecture redesign)
- Deploy and manage production infrastructure
