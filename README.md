I am an aspiring Junior Data Analyst deeply passionate about extracting insights from data. In recent projects, I've undertaken four distinct analyses, including a real video game data exploration. My skill set encompasses effective problem-solving, leadership, and a commitment to continuous learning.

I am actively seeking a role as a Data Analyst where I can gain valuable experience, contribute meaningfully, and continue to grow, aspiring to become the very best version of myself within this dynamic field.
